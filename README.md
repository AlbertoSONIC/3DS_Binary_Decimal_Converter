3DS Binary --> Decimal Converter
==================

This simple homebrew allows you to convert a binary 8 bit number, like 10010110, to a decimal one. It's simple to use: 
you just have to insert an 8 bit binary number by using A button for 1 and B button for 0. You have to remember that
your binary number must be an 8 bit number:

FOR EXAMPLE:

10010110 ---> 8bit

If you have a number with less then 8 bit, like

110101

then you have to add some zeros at the beginning of the number until you reach 8 digits.

FOR EXAMPLE:

110101 ---> 6bit ---> Not supported

00110101 ---> 8bit ---> Completely supported!

So as you can see i simply added two zeros at the beginning of that binary number. It's easy, isn't it?

P.S. Because of the 8 bit limit, don't expect a decimal number higher then 255. (11111111-->255)


Fell free...
==================
.. to take some code from this program. The main purpose of this homebrew isn't offering you a simple
way to convert binary numbers (i'm sure you probabily don't need that). I made this homebrew to help people 
to begin 3DS homebrew development, soo feel free to inspire from that app!


It could be better...
==================
I know and i'm working on it. Once i fully fix it, i'll start finding some ways to improve this program. 
I will update this repo with the latest changes i make, so keep updated!
