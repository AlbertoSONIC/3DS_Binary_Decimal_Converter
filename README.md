3DS Binary --> Decimal Converter
==================

This simple homebrew allows you to convert any binary number to a decimal one. It's simple to use: 
you just have to select binary number lenght, then to insert a binary number by using A button for 1 and B button for 0. Just Use L/R buttons to decrease/increase binary number lenght.


Fell free...
==================
.. to take some code from this program. The main purpose of this homebrew isn't offering you a simple
way to convert binary numbers (i'm sure you probabily don't need that). I made this homebrew to help people 
to begin 3DS homebrew development, soo feel free to inspire from that app!


It could be better...
==================
I know and i'm working on it. Once i fully fix it, i'll start finding some ways to improve this program. 
I will update this repo with the latest changes i make, so keep updated!
